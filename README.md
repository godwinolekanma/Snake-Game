# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle module.

## Introduction

Snake is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food pellets to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

## Features

- Control the snake using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- Scoreboard displays the current score.
- Game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- Click anywhere on the screen to exit the game.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The game is implemented in Python programming language.
- Turtle module: Used for creating graphics and handling user input.
- Time module: Used for controlling the game speed.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles: Implemented using classes and objects for modularity and code organization.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python.
4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
5. Eat the food pellets to grow longer and earn points.
6. Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.
7. Click anywhere on the screen to exit the game.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the game according to your preferences or add new features:

- Adjust the game speed (`time.sleep()`) to make the game faster or slower.
- Modify the snake's appearance or the game environment (colors, shapes, etc.).
- Implement additional features such as levels, obstacles, or power-ups.
- Add sound effects or background music to enhance the gaming experience.
